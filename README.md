## About

The scripts in this repository are intended for entertainment and speculative purposes only. They do not represent real-world quantum computing or actual predictions of the future. Instead, the code aims to explore the concept of quantum entanglement in a fictional and creative context, paired with speculative outputs generated using GPT-4 (a fictional model for creative writing).

## Hopfield Recurrent Neural Network (Hopfield RNN)

The Hopfield RNN is a recurrent neural network with an associative memory. It is based on the Hopfield network, which is used for content-addressable memory and pattern recognition. In this repository, we use a fictional representation of the Hopfield RNN for creative purposes related to quantum entanglement.

## Usage

To use the scripts and explore the speculative outputs:
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Fictional-Script-Quantum-Entanglement-Predict-Future.git`
2. Navigate to the desired script in the cloned repository.
3. Run the script using your preferred Python environment.

Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, such as Qiskit for quantum simulation.
